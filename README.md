# Hotel Management System Database 
The database is created for a resort hotel called **Relaxy Resort**. Relaxy Resort has resort hotels in five countries. </br>

The **RESORT_HOTEL** database stores business information in 10 entities: 
* RESORTS
* EMPLOYEES
* SERVICES
* CUSTOMERS
* RESERVATIONS
* BILLS
* RESTAURANTS
* ROOMS
* STRUCTURES
* ACTIVITIES

Each hotel has many restaurants, rooms, and structures for leisure activities. </br>
The employees may access **CUSTOMER** entity for information about customers, and *CUS_ID* is linked to **RESERVATIONS**, and **BILLS** entities. </br>
The Human Resources Department may access **EMPLOYEES** entity for information about employees, and *EMP_ID* is linked to **SERVICES** entity, which shows the responsibilities of the employees. </br>
The management team may use all the stored data to support decision-making and future-planning. </br>

In the ERD model, there is a many-to-many relationship between **ROOMS** and **RESERVATIONS** connected by an associative entity, **RESROOM**. This relationship indicates one room can be reserved by multiple customers for different dates, and one reservation can book several rooms.
